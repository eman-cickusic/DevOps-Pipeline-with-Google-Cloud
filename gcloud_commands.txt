# Google Cloud Commands Used in This Project

Here are the key Google Cloud commands used throughout the project:

## Setting Up Artifact Registry
```bash
# Create an Artifact Registry repository
gcloud artifacts repositories create devops-repo \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location="REGION"

# Configure Docker to authenticate to Artifact Registry
gcloud auth configure-docker "REGION"-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Building and Pushing Docker Images
```bash
# Build and push the image to Artifact Registry
gcloud builds submit --tag "REGION"-docker.pkg.dev/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/devops-repo/devops-image:v0.1 .
```

## Viewing Project ID
```bash
# View your current project ID
echo $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

Remember to replace:
- "REGION" with your specific Google Cloud region (e.g., us-central1)
- $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID will be automatically filled with your project ID when running in Cloud Shell

These commands demonstrate how to interact with Google Cloud services using the command line.
